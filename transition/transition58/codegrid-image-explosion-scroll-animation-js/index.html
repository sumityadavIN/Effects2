      The world collapsed, but the game survived. In the neon-lit ruins of
      civilization, the last remnants of power aren’t in governments or
      corporations—they’re in the **Oblivion Decks**. Each card carries a
      fragment of lost history, a code of survival, a weapon of deception. The
      elite hoard them. The rebels steal them. The desperate gamble their
      lives for them. Do you have what it takes to **play the game that
      decides the future**?
